**Title:** Add functional tests to the project

**Description:**

Currently, the project only contains unit tests. To improve the quality and reliability of the application, we should implement functional tests. These tests will help ensure that the different components of the application work together as expected in real-world scenarios.

**Tasks:**
- Define the scope and objectives of the functional tests
- Choose a framework or tool for functional testing (e.g., PHPUnit with functional test suites, or another appropriate tool)
- Set up the necessary configuration and environment for running functional tests
- Write initial functional test cases covering key user flows
- Integrate functional tests into the CI/CD pipeline
- Update documentation to describe how to run and maintain functional tests

**Benefits:**
- Detect integration issues early
- Ensure the application behaves as expected from an end-user perspective
- Improve overall code quality and maintainability

**Additional notes:**
- Follow project coding standards and documentation practices
- Review and discuss the proposed approach before implementation
