**Title:** Implement functional tests for the application

**Description:**
The project currently lacks functional tests. Adding functional tests will help ensure that the application works as expected from an end-user perspective and that all components interact correctly.

**Tasks:**
- Define the main user flows to be tested
- Choose and configure a functional testing framework (e.g., PHPUnit functional suite, Codeception, etc.)
- Write initial functional test cases
- Integrate functional tests into the CI/CD pipeline
- Update documentation to explain how to run and maintain functional tests

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of integration issues
- Improved application reliability
- Better code quality and maintainability

**Notes:**
- Follow project coding standards and documentation practices
- Review and discuss the proposed approach before implementation
